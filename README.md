# Helical Materials
Investigating nanoscale materials with helical symmetry via density functional theory simulation. Scripts to construct and calculate band structure properties of helical materials via the GPAW density functional theory package. 

Note: This package is designed for use on the [Argonne Carbon Cluster]{https://wiki.anl.gov/cnm/HPC/Carbon_Cluster_-_Overview}.
